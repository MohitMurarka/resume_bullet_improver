# 💼 Resume Bullet Point Improver

## Overview
The **Resume Bullet Point Improver** is an AI-powered tool that enhances weak or vague resume bullet points using a **self-reflection loop**.  

It uses **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to simulate a conversation between two agents:  

1. **Rewrite Agent** – rewrites bullets concisely and professionally.  
2. **Recruiter Critic** – provides short, actionable feedback to refine the bullet.  

The feedback loops back to the Rewrite Agent, resulting in polished, professional resume bullets.  

---

## Features
- **Iterative self-improvement:** Rewrite → Critique → Rewrite  
- **Token-efficient prompts** to save API usage  
- **Clean final output** of resume bullets  
- **Streamlit UI** for easy interaction  
- **Iteration trace** to visualize the AI’s thought process  

---

## Technologies
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **LangChain-Core**  
- **LangGraph**  
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**  
- **Streamlit**

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohitMurarka/resume_bullet_improver.git
cd resume_bullet_improver
# resume_bullet_improver
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Add your OpenAI API key**
- Copy .env.example to .env
- Add your API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
4.**Run the Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
---
## Usage

1. **Enter a resume bullet:**  
   - Open the Streamlit app in your browser.  
   - Enter a weak, vague, or rough resume bullet in the text area.  

2. **Click "Improve Bullet":**  
   - The AI agents will process the input.  
   - The **Rewrite Agent** rewrites the bullet concisely and professionally.  
   - The **Recruiter Critic** provides short feedback on clarity, impact, and metrics.  
   - Feedback loops back to the Rewrite Agent for refinement.

3. **View the output:**  
   - **Iteration Trace:** Shows each rewrite and recruiter feedback step-by-step.  
   - **Final Improved Bullet:** Displays the polished, professional resume bullet.

### Example Run

**Input:**

```bash
Worked on a React project
```

**Iteration Trace::**

```bash
[Rewrite – Basic Clarification]
Built a React-based web application with reusable components.

[Feedback/Input]
Specify what features were built and highlight technical contribution.

[Rewrite – Technical Detail Added]
Built a React-based web application using reusable components and state management.

[Feedback/Input]
Add measurable impact and outcome-oriented action verbs.

[Rewrite – Impact Focused]
Engineered a React-based web application with reusable components and efficient state management, reducing UI bugs and improving performance.
```

**Final Improved Bullet:**

```bash
Engineered a React-based web application with reusable components and efficient state management, reducing UI bugs and improving performance.
```

## Sample Inputs to Try
- **“Built a machine learning model”**  
- **“Led a team for a college fest”**  
- **“Made a robot that dances”**  
- **“Worked on database project”**  
- **“Did something with AI”**

---

## Notes / Tips

- Use concise bullets for best results.  
- Feedback loop typically runs 1–2 iterations; adjust in `app.py` if needed.  
- Optimized recruiter prompt keeps token usage low.  
- Can extend to handle multiple bullets at once (future improvement).  
- Streamlit UI allows interactive testing and quick demo.
